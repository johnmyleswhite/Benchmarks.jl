# a suite of benchmarks were executed.
#
# Fields:
#
#     uuid::UTF8String: A random UUID that uniquely identifies each run.
#
#     timestamp::UTF8String: The time when we began executing benchmarks.
#
#     julia_sha1::UTF8String: The SHA1 for the Julia Git revision we're working
#         from.
#
#     package_sha1::Nullable{UTF8String}: The SHA1 for the current repo's Git
#         revision (if any). This field is null when the code was not executed
#         inside of a Git repo.
#
#     os::UTF8String: The OS we're running on.
#
#     cpu_cores::Int: The number of CPU cores available.
#
#     arch::UTF8String: The architecture we're running on.
#
#     machine::UTF8String: The machine type we're running on.
#
#     use_blas64::Bool: Was BLAS configured to use 64-bits?
#
#     word_size::Int: The word size of the host machine.

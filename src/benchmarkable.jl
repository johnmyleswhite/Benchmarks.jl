# The @benchmarkable macro combines a tuple of expressions into a function
# that implements the "benchmarkable" protocol. We assume that precompilation,
# when required, will be handled elsewhere; as such, we make no extra calls to
# the core expression that we want to benchmark.
#
# Arguments:
#
#     name: The name of the function that will be generated.
#
#     setup: An expression that will be executed before the core
#         expression starts executing.
#
#     core: The core expression that will be executed.
#
#     teardown: An expression that will be executed after the core
#         expression finishes executing.
#
# Generates:
#
#     A function expression that defines a new function of three-arguments,
#     which are:
#
#     (1): s::Samples: A Samples object in which benchmark data will be stored.
#
#     (2): n_samples::Integer: The number of samples that will be gathered.
#
#     (3): n_evals::Integer: The number of times the core expression will be
#         evaluated per sample.

    # We only support function calls to be passed in `core`, but some syntaxes
    # have special parsing that will lower to a function call upon expansion
    # (e.g., A[i] or user macros). The tricky thing is that keyword functions
    # *also* have a special lowering step that we don't want (they are harder to
    # work with and would obscure some of the overhead of keyword arguments). So
    # we only expand the passed expression if it is not already a function call.

    # Strategy: we create *three* functions:
    # * The outermost function is the entry point. It's simply a closure around
    #   the expressions the user passed in `core` as the arguments to the
    #   benchmarked function. This allows the arguments to be considered setup,
    #   which are evaluated in the correct scope. However, that means that
    #   within this outermost function, the arguments probably aren't
    #   concretely typed. This means that if we were to run the benchmarking
    #   function in this outermost function, we'd end up benchmarking dynamic
    #   dispatch most of the time.  So we introduce a function barrier here.
    # * The second level (`benchfn`) is the benchmarking loop.  Here is where
    #   the real work gets done.  However, if we were to call the benchmarked
    #   function directly here, it might get inlined.  And if it gets inlined,
    #   then LLVM can use optimizations that interact with the test loop itself.
    #   No longer are we simply testing the benchmarked function; we are testing
    #   the benchmark loops.  So in order to circumvent this, we introduce a
    #   third function that is explicitly marked `@noinline`
    # * It is within this third, `inner` function that we call the user's
    #   function that they want to benchmark. This means that all timings will
    #   include the overhead of at least one function call. But it also means
    #   that we can prevent LLVM from doing optimizations that are related to
    #   the benchmarking itself: it must always call the inner function in the
    #   benchmarking function (since at the mid-level it doesn't know what that
    #   function might do), and within the inner function it can only eliminate
    #   code that's unrelated to the return value (since it doesn't know what
    #   the caller might do).

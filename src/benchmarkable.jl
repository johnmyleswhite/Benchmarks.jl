# The @benchmarkable macro combines a tuple of expressions into a function
# that implements the "benchmarkable" protocol. We assume that precompilation,
# when required, will be handled elsewhere; as such, we make no extra calls to
# the core expression that we want to benchmark.
#
# Arguments:
#
#     name: The name of the function that will be generated.
#
#     setup: An expression that will be executed before the core
#         expression starts executing.
#
#     core: The core expression that will be executed.
#
#     teardown: An expression that will be executed after the core
#         expression finishes executing.
#
# Generates:
#
#     A function expression that defines a new function of three-arguments,
#     which are:
#
#     (1): s::Samples: A Samples object in which benchmark data will be stored.
#
#     (2): n_samples::Integer: The number of samples that will be gathered.
#
#     (3): n_evals::Integer: The number of times the core expression will be
#         evaluated per sample.

# recursively add non-constant symbols in module m to a list
find_nonconsts(m, x::Any, list) = list
find_nonconsts(m, s::Symbol, list) = isconst(m, s) ? list : push!(list, s)

    e.head == :line && return # skip line nodes
